# About

WhiteBlue is an interoperability protocol powered by intents. It is the fastest, cheapest, most secure and decentralized way to bridge tokens and execute crosschain swaps.\
\
WhiteBlue Protocol is comprised of three products.

1. The WhiteBlue Bridge, the most capital efficient crosschain transfer solution for end users. WhiteBlue' intents-based framework has proven to facilitate the fastest and cheapest bridging between L2s and Mainnet.
2. WhiteBlue+, is a chain abstraction tool that utilizes crosschain bridge hooks to fulfill user intents. WhiteBlue+ allows developers to integrate bridge + action(s) bundles at the dapp level to promote onboarding and abstract the bridging process away from end users.
3. WhiteBlue Settlement, is a settlement layer for all crosschain intent order flow. Its optimistic design, which defers verification, focuses on gas optimization to significantly reduce crosschain settlement costs for protocols and, ultimately, end users.

As the multichain economy continues to evolve, intents-based settlement is the key to solving interoperability and WhiteBlue is at the core of its execution.
