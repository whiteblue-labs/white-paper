# Providing Bridge Liquidity

In the WhiteBlue ecosystem, liquidity is used to quickly reimburse capital provided by the relayers to bridge users. When an individual provides liquidity to a pool, the individual receives an LP token which represents their individual share of the pool. This share becomes more valuable over time as it accrues fees generated from transfers.

While the amount a liquidity provider withdraws from the pool will always be equal to or greater than what they put in, it's possible a liquidity provider may need to wait until tokens are transferred from non-Ethereum Mainnet chains into the unified liquidity pool on Ethereum Mainnet. You can read more about the benefits of providing liquidity on WhiteBlue [here](https://medium.com/@kevin-uma/why-lp-with-whiteblue-f55b40703ca0).

_\*Please note that WhiteBlue liquidity pools show a projected maximum APY % and a projected minimum APY % for each token. Your liquidity position will earn a maximum return after 100 days of staking without claiming rewards and without removing your capital._&#x20;
