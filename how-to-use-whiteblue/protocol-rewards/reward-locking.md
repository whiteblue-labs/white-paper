# Reward Locking

## **Program Details**

### Overview

WhiteBlue is the first protocol to implement reward locking. It is used to further incentivize bridge liquidity positions by incrementally increasing reward APY over time for users who stake capital. For WhiteBlue' reward locking programming, an LP's multiplier starts at 1x on day zero and can grow linearly to a maximum of 2x after capital has been staked for 100+ days.

Reward multipliers reset to 1x once rewards have been claimed or liquidity is unstaked.

In September 2023, [a Snapshot proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/whiteblueprotocol.eth/proposal/0xb2bd26a68cceba984275a10c67efe3b06f24fc2a48907197614b62dc48d1dfc7) was passed to increase liquidity pool APY % by 50% and reduce the original multipler number of 3x to 2x. The following emissions changes were implemented:

* ~~50,000~~ → \~75,000 WBL per day for WhiteBlue ETH LP tokens
* ~~50,000~~ → \~75,000 WBL per day for WhiteBlue USDC LP tokens
* ~~5,000~~ → \~7,500 WBL per day for WhiteBlue USDT LP tokens
* ~~5,000~~ → \~7,500 WBL per day for WhiteBlue DAI LP tokens
* ~~5,000~~ → \~7,500 WBL per day for WhiteBlue WBTC LP tokens
* ~~20,000~~ → \~30,000 WBL per day for WhiteBlue WBL LP tokens

#### Information for Other Projects Looking To Implement Reward Locking

Risk Labs (the foundation that supports UMA and WhiteBlue Protocol) has  deployed a contract called the[ Accelerating Distributor](https://github.com/whiteblue-protocol/whiteblue-token/blob/master/contracts/AcceleratingDistributor.sol) ([audit](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/whiteblue-token-and-token-distributor-audit/)) to allow any project to implement the concept of reward locking. You can read the full details in our[ Reward Locking article](https://medium.com/whiteblue-protocol/introducing-reward-locking-78b26c792b11).

### How to Start Earning a Reward Multiplier &#x20;

When you stake LP tokens on WhiteBlue, you are automatically entered into the reward locking program and will immediately begin earning a higher APY incrementally each day. Please note that your APY multiplier will reset to 1x once capital is unstaked or rewards are claimed.

### Adding Additional Liquidity to Stake in Reward Locking.&#x20;

When you add additional tokens to your already existing staked assets your reward multiplier will change based on the average age of capital. Our formula uses the time-weighted sum of deposits.&#x20;

For example, if you deposit 10 tokens at time 1, the average age of capital is 1. If you deposit the next 5 tokens at time 5, the average age of capital = (1 \* (10/15) + 5 \* (5/15)) = 2.3333
